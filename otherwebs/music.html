          <p> Music is something that's pretty much exclusive to the human race. It's a human activity and part of every
            culture in the world. After all, humans are social animals for a good reason. When people cooperate within
            groups, stuff gets done.
            Basically, when people join together and use their unique skills, talents, and knowledge for a more
            significant cause, much can be accomplished.
            For example, no single individual alone can create a rocket, fly to the moon, and then come back down to
            earth. It took a great many people to achieve this feat, and America realized this fact.
            With all that being said, it's now easier to understand how music and culture can come together. Culture is
            a means of ensuring stability and survival for society, and music works towards that goal by bringing people
            together.

            How do you incorporate music into your life? Itâ€™s easy to do. Although the <span>AARP</span>  survey found that those who
            actively listened to music showed the strongest brain benefits, even those who primarily listened to
            background music showed benefits, so you can turn that music on right now. Music can lift your mood, so put
            on a happy tune if you are feeling blue. Uptempo music can give you energy. And if you combine music with an
            aerobic and social activity, you can receive the maximum health benefit from it. Participate in a Zumba
            class. Do jazz aerobics. Jump to the rhythms of rock & roll. Or, better yet, go dancing. (And yes, in a
            pandemic, you can still benefit by doing these activities virtually.)
