          <p> Skateboarding is an action sport originating in the United States that involves riding and
            performing tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an entertainment
            industry job, and a method of transportation. Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many
            skateboarders throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated
            $4.8 billion in annual revenue, with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was
            announced that skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, for both male and
            female teams.
            Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, freestyle BMXers,
            aggressive skaters, and very recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas
            in which the activity, although illegal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas, and parks.

        <div class="text2">For me ,Skateboarding reduces anxiety by the simple fact it constantly puts you in anxiety inducing
          situation. If you’re hooked and want to progress, there’s no other way but to confront fear. It forces you to
          gain control over your own thoughts, which is effective for people who ruminate and overthink a lot.
          Through focus and dedication, skateboarding forces you to put aside your limiting beliefs and fears to make
          your dreams come true.
          I will give an example of a skater jumping down a massive set of stairs. While trying the trick, he
          knows he can get hurt a bunch of different ways. But he chooses to put all that aside, believing in his
          ability and choosing not to be controlled by his fear.</div>
